Data Sources:

ExerciseDB API (https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb): Provides comprehensive exercise data including names, instructions, target muscle groups, and equipment needed.

Foundation Foods Nutritional Information CSV (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets): Contains detailed nutritional data for various foods, including calories, macronutrients, and serving sizes.

Faker Gem: To generate user profiles, workout logs, and fitness goals.

Data Structure and Integration:
1. Exercise Data (from ExerciseDB API)
This API provides exercise information in JSON format. Key data points include:

Exercise name
Exercise type (strength, cardio, flexibility, etc.)
Target muscle group
Required equipment
Difficulty level
Instructions
Demo image/GIF URL

2. Nutritional Information (from CSV)
This dataset contains:

Food item name
Calorie content per serving
Protein content (grams)
Carbohydrate content (grams)
Fat content (grams)
Serving size information
Food category

3. User and Workout Data (from Faker)
Generated data will include:

User profiles (name, age, height, weight, fitness level)
Workout logs (date, duration, exercises performed)
User fitness goals and progress tracking

Data Integration Plan:

Importing Exercise Data:

Pull exercise information from the ExerciseDB API
Create records in the exercises table
Categorize exercises by type and target muscle


Importing Nutritional Data:

Import food data from the CSV
Create records in the foods table
Categorize foods and create appropriate associations


Creating User and Workout Data:

Generate fake user profiles with Faker gem
Create sample workout routines and logs
Associate workouts with exercises through the join table
Generate meal logs and associate them with foods and users



This database design includes multiple one-to-many relationships (users to workouts, users to meal_logs, food_categories to foods) and multiple many-to-many relationships (workouts to exercises, meal_logs to foods), which will help satisfy requirements 1.4 and 1.5 in the rubric.
With this design, users will be able to:

Create and track workout routines
Log meals and track nutritional intake
Monitor their progress toward fitness goals
Browse and search exercises by type, muscle group, or equipment
